Project #1: Merge Join

Group members:
Ka Chun Lee :210087484 (prism: viclee)
Bochao Wang:215237902 (prism: bochao)

We started off the project by discussing the general idea of the algorithm
and consult with the textbook on P.458.

We decided to work on our own and collaborate later. 
Therefore, we both have even contribution thoughout the project.

The most challenge part of the project is to debug in order to pass the test cases, especially query 2.
it took us days to compile the project and more days to pass test cases.

The usage and behavior of IO buffer is not obvious, as the operation is behind the scene.
We need to set and pin point many conditions to control the flow of the get_next() while loop body.
and we discovered the io_buf caused problem which failed query 2 miserably.
After many nights and re-writing the get_next() method, somehow it worked.....
It must be we hadn't catch the flow of the loop under certain condition in many-many join.
